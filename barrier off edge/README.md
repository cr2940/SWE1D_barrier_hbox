`parameters_h_box_wave.txt` sets the parameters such as barrier height, number of cells, etc. 

`setplot_h_box_wave.py` is the simple plot setup, whereas `setplot_h_box_wave_2.py` has more colors for bathymetry and water.

`shallow_1D_redistribute_wave.py` implements the LTS method, whereas `shallow_1D_redistribute_wave_MB.py` implements the double h-box method.

`sill_h_box_wave.py` is the setup of the problem, where you can also choose which method (LTS vs dbl h-box) and setplot to use.
